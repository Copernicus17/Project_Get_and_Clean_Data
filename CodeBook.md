The raw data for the project was downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

I utilized the features.txt, activity_labels.txt, train/X_train.txt, train/y_train.txt,
test/X_test.txt, test/y_test.txt, train/subject_train.txt, and test/subject_test.txt 
files for this exercise.

[The original README.txt file (attached below) describes each of these files. A full 
description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones .]

The code extracted 66 columns from the x files; specifically those columns with variable
names that included mean() for the mean value or std() for the standard deviation.
Note: I wasn't sure whether to include or exclude variables with meanFreq(); since 
meanFreq() is a weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency. 
I debated, but ultimately chose to exclude variables with meanFreq(); since I wasn't 
specifically instructed to include them. 

I averaged the 66 extracted columns from the x files for
each activity and subject.

Transformations: 
----------------
- The training and the test files were combined.
- The labels in the activity_label files were used to add descriptions to the y files.
- The feature nmes from the features.txt file wwas used as labels in the x dataset.
- The subject, x, and y files were combined into one dataset.
- As instructed, I averaged the 66 extracted columns from the x files for
each activity and subject. 

Variables: 
----------
Following is a variable listing. The variable names are from the features.txt file.
I modified the variable names to prefix avg (so we know they are averages), and 
removed the dashes (-) and parentheses () characters.

- The activity variable was derived from the y text files the activity_labels text files.
- The subject_id variable came from the subject test files.
- The other 66 variables are averages of mean and standard deviation columns (by activity and
  subject) from the x files.
- The units were specified in the website.

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
